# Detect Cycle in an undirected graph - BFS

Practice [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-an-undirected-graph/1?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article&itm_campaign=practice_card)

Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. 

![Alt text](/images/graph-b.png)
> No Cycle


![Alt text](/images/graph-a.png)
> Cycle exists

## Note
Graph can also be disconnected -> Check for every node as source/starting node.

Intiution:
- Start from one node(unvisited) and explore all nodes.
- Use visited array to keep track of explored nodes.
- If during traversal we find a node that is already explored/visited, it means that we came from two different paths and explored same node and thus the cycle exists. 
- Continue traversal, until all nodes are visited or we find a cycle.



```
bool checkCycleBFS(vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool> &visited, int source)
{
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(source);
    
    while(!q.empty())
    {
        int curr = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        if(visited[curr])
            return true;
            
        visited[curr] = true;

        
        for(auto dest: adj[curr])
        {
            if(!visited[dest])
            {
                q.push(dest);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// Function to detect cycle in an undirected graph.
bool isCycle(vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
    vector<bool> visited(adj.size(), false);
    
    // Check every node to avoid  missing disconnected components
    for(int i=0;i<adj.size();i++)
    {
        if(!visited[i] && checkCycleBFS(adj, visited, i))
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```



### Time Complexity: O(V+E) + O(N), 
We are exploring every vertex V and exploring all its edges. 
O(N) -> For covering disconnected components



### Space Complexity: O(N)+O(V+E), 
O(N) to keep visited nodes, and O(V+E) to create the adjacency list.
