# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Practice [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSumUtil(TreeNode* root, int &maxi) {
        if(!root)
            return 0;
        
        int leftSum = max(0, maxPathSumUtil(root->left, maxi));
        int rightSum = max(0, maxPathSumUtil(root->right, maxi));

        maxi = max(maxi, root->val + leftSum + rightSum);

        return root->val + max(leftSum, rightSum);
    }
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        maxPathSumUtil(root, maxi);
        return maxi;
    }
};
```
